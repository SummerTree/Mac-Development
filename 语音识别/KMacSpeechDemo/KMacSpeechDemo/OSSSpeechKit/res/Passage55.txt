[00:00.91] Passage 55. Stress and Relaxation
[00:03.82] It is commonly believed that only rich middle-aged businessmen suffer from stress.
[00:07.03] In fact anyone may become ill as a result of stress if they experience a lot of worry over a long period and their health is not especially good.
[00:10.24] Stress can be a friend or an enemy:
[00:12.95] it can warn you that you are under too much pressure and should change your way of life.
[00:19.68] It can kill you if you don’t notice the warning signals.
[00:21.43] Doctors agree that it is probably the biggest single cause of illness in the Western world.
[00:24.24] When we are very frightened and worried our bodies produce certain chemicals to help us fight what is troubling us.
[00:27.30] Unfortunately, these chemicals produce the energy needed to run away fast from an object of fear,
[00:30.26] and in modern life that’s often impossible. If we don’t use up these chemicals,
[00:32.77] or if we produce too many of them, they may actually harm us.
[00:35.42] The parts of the body that are most affected by stress are the stomach, heart,skin, head and back.
[00:39.34] Stress can cause car accidents, heart attacks, and alcoholism,
[00:43.60] and may even drive people to suicide.
[00:48.17] Our living and working conditions may put us under stress.
[00:52.68] Overcrowding in large cities, traffic jams,
[00:54.44] competition for jobs, worry about the future,
[00:57.40] any big changes in our lives, may cause stress.
[00:59.46] Some British doctors have pointed out that one of Britain’s worst waves of influenza happened soon after the new coins came into use.
[01:01.46] Also if you have changed jobs or moved house in recent months you are more likely to fall ill than if you haven’t.
[01:03.77] And more people commit suicide in times of inflation.
[01:05.47] As with all illnesses, prevention is better than cure.
[01:10.24] If you find you can’t relax, it is a sign of danger.
[01:12.20] “When you’re taking work home,
[01:14.36] when you can’t enjoy an evening with friends,
[01:16.16] when you haven’t time for outdoor exercise—
[01:18.83] that is the time to stop and ask yourself whether your present life really suits you.”
[01:20.63] Says one family doctor.
[01:23.14] “ Then it’s time to join a relaxation class, or take up dancing, painting or gardening.”
