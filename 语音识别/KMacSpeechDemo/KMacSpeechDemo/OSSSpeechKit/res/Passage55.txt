[00:00.91] Hello and welcome to WWDC.
[00:03.82] My name is Roman and I'm a Shortcuts Engineer at Apple.
[00:07.03] Today, I'm going to share some tips on how to efficiently debug your Siri and Shortcuts support.
[00:10.24] Let's start by taking a look at how you can automate Siri queries using the scheme editor in Xcode.
[00:12.95] You can provide the Siri intent query from the get-go, so you don't actually have to trigger Siri and speak to it when you debug your extension.
[00:19.68] When you're attaching to your intents extension, you have an option to choose between Siri and the Shortcuts app as the host process.
[00:21.43] Sometimes, you might wonder why you don't keep breakpoints in your intents UI extension,
[00:24.24] while you're being attached to an intents extension in Xcode. This is because both of these extensions are separate processes.
[00:27.30] You can use the Xcode debug menu to attach to multiple processes at the same time.
[00:30.26] So you implemented SiriKit support in your app,
[00:32.77] but you're getting "Sorry there was a problem with the app," when you execute your intent in Siri.
[00:35.42] Now what can you do about this?
[00:39.34] First, make sure that you call your completion handlers of your intent handling protocol methods before the 10 second timeout.
[00:43.60] You also need to make sure that you call the completion handlers only once,
[00:48.17] otherwise an exception will be thrown in your process.
[00:52.68] You should also verify that your process is not crashing in the middle of the request.
[00:54.44] Open devices and similars in Xcode,
[00:57.40] and click the view device logs button,
[00:59.46] and scan it for crashes in your processes.
[01:01.46] Using OS_log statements and the Console app can help you understand how multiple processes work together.
[01:03.77] When composing your OS_log statements,
[01:05.47] you can prefix them with an emoji or some other unique keyword and then use the Console app to filter by your unique keyword,
[01:10.24] to get an accurate timeline of events in all processes involved.
